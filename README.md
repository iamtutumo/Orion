<h3>📌 Observations and Recommendations</h3>

 - I recommend using VPS from Contabo, Hetzner, Digital Ocean or AWS. We do not recommend or encourage using other VPS.
- The Server must be "zeroed" to install the tools. Running Setup with other tools in progress may result in data loss.
- It is recommended to use Ubuntu 20.04, with a minimum of 4Gb and 2vCPU. 16Gb+ and 6vCPU+ are recommended.
- Before trying to install new tools, or even update something, it is highly recommended.

<h3>💿 How to run the installer</h3>
<p>Thinking about making the installation of the tools as easy as possible, we created a short code that will update your server, download the setup script and execute it. Everything so that anyone can use it.</p>

<p>Just run this code on your server terminal:</p>

```
bash <(curl -sSL setup.oriondesign.art.br)
```
<p>After that, just wait a few moments while the script starts and finally, install the tools you want..</p>
